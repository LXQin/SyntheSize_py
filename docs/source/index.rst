Welcome to SyntheSize documentation!
===================================

SyntheSize is a supervised learning framework designed for determining the optimal sample size for classification by utilizing synthesized data across various sample sizes. 
This framework employs the inverse power law function (IPLF) to accurately model different sample sizes and their corresponding classification accuracies. 
SyntheSize also evaluates the generated/augmented data through heatmap and UMAP(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).

More information and the original implementation in R can be found in this `Github repository <https://github.com/LXQin/SyntheSize>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
